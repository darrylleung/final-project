After Charles Ingram (played by Matthew Macfadyen of “Succession”), a former British Army major, won the grand prize on the ratings juggernaut “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,” he, his wife, Diana (Sian Clifford of “Fleabag”), and Tecwen Whittock (Michael Jibson), an accomplice, were found guilty of cheating. Diana and Tecwen, who had been seated in the audience, were said to have hinted at the correct answers by coughing. The couple were vilified in the British media, yet they still claim innocence.
